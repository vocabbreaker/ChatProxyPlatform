    # This ensures the volume is scoped to this compose setup if it needs to be unique,
    # though typically the project name prefix handles this.
    # For maximum safety, you could use a unique name like 'debug-postgres-data' here
    # and in the service volume mapping, if you suspect collision.
    # However, 'postgres-data' should be fine with the 'down --volumes' command.
