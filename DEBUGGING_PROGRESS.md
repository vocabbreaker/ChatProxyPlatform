## 🔍 Issues Encountered & Resolved

### 1. **Drive Space Critical Issue** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: C: drive had only 1GB free space, insufficient for Docker volumes

**Investigation**:
- Detected C: drive: 1GB free (critical)
- Detected D: drive: 1.9TB free (RAID configuration)

**Solution**:
- Created `configure_drives.py` script to automatically:
  - Detect available drives and RAID arrays
  - Update all `docker-compose.yml` files
  - Migrate volumes from named volumes to `D:/DockerVolumes/*` paths
- Updated 5 docker-compose files across all services

**Result**: ✅ All Docker volumes now on D: drive, C: drive preserved

---

### 2. **MongoDB Connection Failures** 🗄️

#### Issue 2a: Auth Service MongoDB Wrong Volume
**Problem**: auth-service mongodb-auth container using wrong volume path

**Error**:
```
mongodb-auth using D:/DockerVolumes/mongodb-proxy instead of mongodb-auth
```

**Investigation**:
- Checked `auth-service/docker-compose.dev.yml`
- Found volume path typo/misconfiguration

**Solution**:
- Updated docker-compose.dev.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - D:/DockerVolumes/mongodb-auth:/data/db  # Fixed from mongodb-proxy
```

**Result**: ✅ Auth MongoDB now uses correct isolated volume

---

#### Issue 2b: Flowise-Proxy MongoDB Authentication Failed
**Problem**: flowise-proxy couldn't connect to MongoDB

**Error**:
```
Authentication failed: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: wrong password
```

**Investigation**:
- Compared `.env` MONGODB_URL password with `docker-compose.yml`
- Found mismatch:
  - `.env`: `78wRAfGjX8eH.jZ6XfGXfFr2jTUvEixH` (old)
  - `docker-compose.yml`: `65424b6a739b4198ae2a3e08b35deeda` (correct)

**Solution**:
- Updated `flowise-proxy-service-py/.env`:
```env
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://admin:65424b6a739b4198ae2a3e08b35deeda@mongodb-proxy:27017/flowise_proxy?authSource=admin
```

**Result**: ✅ Flowise-proxy MongoDB connection successful

---

### 3. **JWT Secret Synchronization** 🔐 CRITICAL

**Problem**: Services couldn't authenticate each other due to JWT secret mismatch

**Investigation**:
- Checked JWT secrets in:
  - `auth-service/.env`: Had correct secrets
  - `accounting-service/.env`: Had placeholder values `your-secret-key-here`
  - `flowise-proxy-service-py/.env`: Had different secrets

**Impact**:
- Accounting service couldn't verify tokens from auth service
- Cross-service communication failed

**Solution**:
- Generated new secrets using `generate_secrets.bat`
- Synchronized across all three services:
```env
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=II-OYp-J9ydG8K5k1tufUf3CrCu74v6RBoEwwlU5-o.jko-7U.4rei9cJcxSaeh0
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=K4.xbCPVjEvJQfvrTOZsG17l_YOmmN8xwQg3hBUKIs3nFZ3K06vjThJ9mqxpl1I_
```

**Result**: ✅ All services now share same JWT secrets, authentication works

---

### 4. **Email Verification Field Naming** 📧 CRITICAL

**Problem**: Admin user couldn't login despite database showing verified

**Error**:
```json
{
  "error": "Email not verified",
  "statusCode": 403
}
```

**Investigation**:
- Checked MongoDB users collection:
  - Found field: `emailVerified: true`
- Searched auth-service code for verification check
- Discovered code uses field name: `isVerified` not `emailVerified`

**Root Cause**: Database field naming inconsistency

**Solution**:
- Updated MongoDB document:
```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  {email: 'admin@example.com'},
  {$set: {isVerified: true, role: 'admin'}}
)
```

**Result**: ✅ Admin login successful

**Learning**: Auth-service uses `isVerified` field, not `emailVerified`

---

### 5. **Missing package-lock.json Files** 📦

**Problem**: Docker builds failed for auth-service and bridge-ui

**Error**:
```
npm ERR! Cannot read package-lock.json
```

**Investigation**:
- Checked both directories - no package-lock.json files
- Node.js requires package-lock.json for reproducible builds

**Solution**:
- Ran `npm install` in both directories:
```bash
cd auth-service && npm install
cd bridge && npm install
```

**Result**: ✅ package-lock.json files generated, builds successful

---

### 6. **User Creation & Credit Allocation** 💰

**Problem**: Admin reported "no credit" after system setup

**Investigation**:
- Checked accounting-service PostgreSQL database
- Found `user_accounts` table empty
- Found `credit_allocations` table empty

**Root Cause**: Credit system initialization not automated

**Solution**:
- Created PowerShell script to:
  1. Login to auth-service (get JWT token)
  2. Call accounting-service `/api/credits/allocate` endpoint
  3. Allocate credits for each user:
     - Admin: 10,000 credits
     - Teachers (3): 5,000 credits each
     - Students (5): 1,000 credits each

**Result**: ✅ All 9 users created with correct credit allocations

---

### 7. **API Endpoint Discovery** 🔍

**Problem**: Initial attempt to check balance used wrong endpoint

**Error**:
```
GET /api/v1/accounting/balance → 404 Not Found
```

**Investigation**:
- Searched flowise-proxy codebase
- Found correct endpoint in `app/api/chat.py`:
  - Line 1024: `@router.get("/credits")`

**Solution**:
- Used correct endpoint:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/credits
```

**Result**: ✅ Credit balance retrieval successful

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. **Field Naming Standards Matter**
- Different services may use different field names for same concept
- Always check actual code, not just documentation
- Example: `isVerified` vs `emailVerified`

### 2. **JWT Secret Synchronization is Critical**
- All services in microservices architecture must share JWT secrets
- Single point of failure without synchronization
- Solution: Use `generate_secrets.bat` and distribute

### 3. **Docker Volume Paths on Windows**
- Named volumes don't give control over disk placement
- Explicit paths (`D:/DockerVolumes/*`) ensure disk selection
- Critical for systems with multiple drives

### 4. **Database Schema Discovery**
- Don't assume column names match documentation
- Always use `\d table_name` in PostgreSQL
- Always use `.find()` queries in MongoDB to see actual documents

### 5. **Credit System Initialization**
- Requires both user account creation AND credit allocation
- Two separate services (auth + accounting) must be synchronized
- JWT token needed to allocate credits (security requirement)
